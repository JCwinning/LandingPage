## Key Architectural Shift: Dual-Mode Storage

The most significant update to the project is the introduction of **Dual Data Storage Modes**, allowing for both privacy and portability:

-   **Local Mode**: Data is stored securely in a local `shops.csv` file. Perfect for quick use without any setup.
-   **Cloud Mode**: Leverages **Supabase** for real-time synchronization across devices. Your journeys follow you wherever you go.

## Features

-   **🔍 Infinite Discovery**: Seamlessly integrate with the **Gaode (Amap) Map API**. Search for any location and add it to your collection with a single click.
-   **🎨 Dynamic Visualization**: Interactive maps powered by **Folium**, featuring:
    *   Custom category-specific icons (Coffee, Dining, Scenery, etc.).
    *   Intuitive color coding: **Red** for "Visited", **Green** for "Want to Visit".
-   **📸 Visual Memories**: (Cloud Mode) Capture and upload multiple photos for each location, hosted securely on Supabase Storage.
-   **⭐ Deep Insights**: Track more than just locations. Store star ratings (1-5), personal notes, and visit timestamps.
-   **⚡ Live Filtering**: Instantly filter your view by journey type or visit status to focus on what matters.
