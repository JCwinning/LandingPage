# Introduction

In the era of information explosion, keeping up with content across multiple platforms like YouTube, Bilibili, Spotify, and Xiaohongshu can be overwhelming. The **LLM Summary System** is a powerful, unified tool designed to solve this by automating the process of downloading, transcribing, and summarizing content using state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).

This project provides a seamless experience for converting long-form audio/video content into concise, actionable summaries.

# Key Features

The system is packed with features that make it a robust choice for content consumption:

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Unified interface for YouTube, Bilibili, Spotify, Xiaohongshu, and Xiaoyuzhou FM.
- **Intelligent Processing**: Automatic chunking for large files and transcripts to handle long-form content (up to 2M tokens).
- **High-Quality Transcription**: Uses MLX Whisper (optimized for Apple Silicon) with an OpenAI Whisper fallback.
- **Advanced Summarization**: Support for 15+ LLM models (including Qwen, GLM, DeepSeek, GPT-4, Gemini, and Grok).
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Convert summaries back to audio using Google Cloud TTS, Qwen, or Gemini.
- **Search Integration**: Automatically finds related reading materials using AI-extracted keywords.
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: A user-friendly Streamlit web interface with live updates.

# Architecture Overview

The system follows a streamlined pipeline:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[URL Input] --> B[Platform Detection]
    B --> C[Content Download]
    C --> D[Audio Extraction]
    D --> E[Transcription - Whisper]
    E --> F[AI Summarization]
    F --> G[TTS Generation]
    G --> H[File Output + Web Display]
```

### Core Components

- **`app.py`**: The main Streamlit web interface handle concurrent URL submission and dynamic queuing.
- **`download.py`**: A unified downloader with comprehensive retry logic for all supported platforms.
- **`process.py`**: Handles audio transcription and AI summarization with intelligent chunking.
- **`config.py`**: Manages LLM model configurations and environment variables.
- **`tts.py`**: Multi-provider text-to-speech with hash-based caching.

# Advanced Intelligence

What sets this system apart is its handling of complex tasks:

### Intelligent Chunking
To prevent RAM exhaustion and handle extremely long content:
- **Audio**: Automatically splits files longer than 60 minutes for transcription.
- **Text**: Transcripts exceeding 240K characters are split into 100K character chunks.

### Search Integration
After generating a summary, the system extracts key terms and searches for supplemental materials via DuckDuckGo (or Baidu as a fallback). This ensures you get a well-rounded understanding of the topic.

# Getting Started

The easiest way to run the system is via the Web Interface:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JCwinning/llm_summary.git
   cd llm_summary
   ```

2. **Configure your environment**: Create a `.env` file with your API keys (OpenAI, DashScope, etc.).

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

# Conclusion

The LLM Summary System is more than just a downloader; it's a personalized AI research assistant. Whether you're a student, researcher, or just someone who wants to stay informed, this tool can significantly boost your productivity by distilling hours of content into minutes of reading.
